KV 344009 (ML & Pattern Classification): TRAINING DATA
======================================================

Dear colleagues,

we have now compiled the training data for you.
There are 2 x 14 text files (.arff format; can be directly
loaded into WEKA): 14 hours of radio, one file each for
music and speech detection, respectively.

The format should be self-explanatory: header part with
names and types of features ("attributes"); data part with
training examples. Each line is a training example, the last
"attribute" is the class label.

You can download a 220 MB .zip file containing all of these:

Please let me know if you encounter any problems.
Sanity check: each file should contain around 5 x 3,600 = 18,000 examples.
("around" because the audios were not cut precisely to a length of
60:00 minutes.)

And remember: we don't expect you to necessarily use all the data in your
experiments ... use (well chosen) subsets if the computation load becomes
too heavy!

Have fun!
